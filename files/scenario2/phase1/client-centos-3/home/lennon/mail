yup, i got in - thx!  

its nice to make a break from larry's group, what a bunch of Losers!

i set up a reverse shell backdoor to our main server.  it tries to connect once every 5 minutes.  

we should probably set that up on some backdoors on other machines also, maybe at staggered times.

more later.

you DO realize that you just used those same keywords on THIS system in OUR email
exchange, if the admins are searching for THEM they'll find US now, too, lenny...

in other news niko's joining us, he got into a different server.  he'll create a 
backdoor there also, same deal.
