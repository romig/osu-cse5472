i just heard that larry came up with a brilliant plan to "tag" all of their files with 
keywords, like TANSTAAFL or some goofy scheme involving 4 alphas, 4 numbers, a space and repeat (like
stup0000 iiid0000).  what possible use would that be?  i mean, maybe if they *lost* their way 
and didn't know where their stuff is, but who does that?  i think it just gives the admins
a way to find them.

hide in plain sight, that's my motto.  that way we won't stick out and get caught...

be safe!

i didn't think of that, obviously.  sorry :-)

i got into another server, i've set up accounts for myself and renata.  looks like 
larry's crew got on there also.  i wonder if they'll even notice us?

don't call me lenny, you KNOW i hate that.
