It has come to our attention that using a single keyword like TANSTAAFL is a 
really bad idea, as it makes it easy for the so-called "white hats" to find 
our stuff.

So Larry suggested we different keywords that match a pattern that only we know.  
Clever Larry, eh?

So use keywords similar to "blah3514 plug1234" (4 letters, 4 numbers, a space, 4 letters, 4 numbers)

That'll throw them off!  Larry says he's working on a rotating encryption scheme 
that he's calling "rot13" - I can't wait for that level of uber secretiveness!
