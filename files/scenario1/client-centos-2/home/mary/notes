I've been researching possible targets for our next job.

Knitting and stuff like that is probably pretty popular during the lockdown,
right?  Everyone I know is knitting.  So if we can knock off the main web 
sites that supply yarn, tools, wool, and patterns we can disrupt all of
the fiber arts!!  People will pay us tens of dollars to restore service!  

I've been doing some research (you know, google? :-) and I think I found the 
perfect target, rav-something.com, or maybe .org?  I forget.  

Note to self: look in browser history to get that web site, its critical!
